# Exploring Bees

This project has a few main parts:
* Generating a world with resources and a way to sense them
* Creating a hive that can command bees to do certain tasks
* Creating bees that can be semi-autonomous
* Using deep learning to train the hive to find the most efficient way to maximize food, and minimize time to plunder the map.
